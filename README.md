# 🏠 Linear Regression on Housing Data

We perform a simple linear regression to predict **house prices** based on **area** using `scikit-learn`.

---

## 🔢 Objective

> Predict `price` of a house based on its `area` (in square feet).

---

## 📁 Dataset

- File: `Housing.csv`
- Features used:
  - **Independent Variable (X)**: `area`
  - **Target Variable (y)**: `price`

---

## 🚀 Steps

1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Split into training and testing sets
3. Fit a linear regression model
4. Evaluate using MAE, MSE, R²
5. Plot the regression line
6. Print the model coefficients
